**What it is noVa64?**

The noVa64 (With an uppercase V) is a new computer built around the 65816 CPU. Inspired by the age of 8-bit computers, it's envisioned as a alternate-universe succesor to the Commodore 8-bit series of computers. Instead of adquiring the Amiga, could've Commodore created a 16-bit machine around this CPU? The noVa64 is designed and built by a hobbyist (me) who will need to learn pretty much everything on the go.

**What it isn't noVa64?**

It's not a professional or commercially viable product.  It's not meant to be mass produced. It's not a recreation of any pre-existing computer, although it will be inspired by many.

**When will it be ready?**

Hopefully, at some point. That's all I can say.
