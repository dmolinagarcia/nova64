## So.. what´s the plan?
Great, another legit question! So far, there´s none. I'm only gathering some random thoughts for now. The **feature creep madness** phase seems to be wearing off, and I haven't added anything new to the requirements for two days already.
I'm very much aware of the need for a plan. A complex project like this is bound to fail without one. So, let's draft one!

Firstly, whenever the **feature creep madness** is done, I'm going to start working on the general architecture of the computer. How will all the pieces fit together? RAM, Boot ROM, CPU, Video, peripherals... This step should produce a rough block diagram of the computer

Then, deep dive into each of the different blocks. They will probably be

- CPU
- Memory
- Video
- Audio
- Peripherals

During the deep dive phase, each of the componentes will be try and tested, with probably different prototypes build along the way. 

I've been using for some time the Github Projects functionality and I find it very useful. As I identify things to solve, they will find a place in there.
